# Icy-Hot Power

*Authors: Penelope King, Garvey Li*


## Introduction

### The Question and the Dataset

Is the distribution of outage causes the same in both winter and summer?

This EDA project is based on data collected on [major power outage events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182#t0005) that occurred in the United States. Each row of data contains information relevant to our question such such as outage times (month, start date), location (U.S. climate regions, climate of location), and what caused the outage (categories such as severe weather, intentional attack, and details about the categories)
