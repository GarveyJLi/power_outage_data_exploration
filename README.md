# Power Outage EDA Project

*Authors: Penelope King, Garvey Li*


## Intro

### Dataset

This project is based on data collected on [major power outage events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182#t0005) that occurred in the United States. Each row of data contains information such as information about the outage time (year, month, start date, restoration date, start time, restoration time, duration), location (state, climate region, climate, NERC region), what caused the outage (categories such as severe weather, intentional attack, details about the categories, and the names of hurricanes if applicable), and the effects of the outage (number of customers affected, changes in peak demand).
